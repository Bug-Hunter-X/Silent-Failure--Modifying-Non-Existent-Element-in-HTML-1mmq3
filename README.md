This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML. The bug involves attempting to modify the innerHTML of an element that doesn't exist.  Unlike many JavaScript errors that throw exceptions, this results in a silent failure where the code executes without error, but with no effect. The solution provides the correct way to manipulate the DOM by checking for the existence of elements before modifying them.
